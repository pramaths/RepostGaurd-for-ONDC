# RepostGaurd-for-ONDC
The "ReportGuard" project aims to enhance trust and transparency in online marketplaces, specifically for the Online National Delivery Corporation (ONDC). It involves the implementation of a user reporting system where users can flag and report others who frequently resend products purchased from e-commerce platforms. Reported users are tracked, and their report history is made accessible to other integrated companies, enabling them to make informed decisions based on the user's history. By providing a secure and privacy-conscious solution, ReportGuard promotes fair and reliable transactions, protecting both sellers and buyers in the online marketplace ecosystem.

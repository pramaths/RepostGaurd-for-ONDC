# RepostGaurd-for-ONDC
"ReportGuard" enhances trust in online marketplaces by enabling e-commerce companies to report a refund/return order placed by any user on their platform, on their platform, providing transparency and enabling other integrated companies to access the user's report history for informed decision-making.

This system helps in the decision-making process for other ONDC participants, when they are figuring out whether to initiate a refund or not to a user.

Still don't get it?
Assume, you ask for a refund without any reason on MagicPin, then the magicpin customer support team can go to ReportGuard and just submit that XYZ person with this phone number has initiated a refund on our platform.
In the next week, you ask for a refund on Meesho, then the Meesho's customer support team have a reference to check your refund/return behaviour online.

This helps them track repititive return/refund requests.
